# Find maximum volume of a cuboid
You are given a perimeter & the area. Your task is to return the maximum volume that can be made in the form of a cuboid from the given perimeter and surface area.
Note: Round off to 2 decimal places and for the given parameters, it is guaranteed that an answer always exists.

### Examples
#### Input: 
perimeter = 22, area = 15
#### Output:
3.02
#### Explanation:
The maximum attainable volume of the cuboid is 3.02

#### Input:
perimeter = 20, area = 5
#### Output:
0.33
#### Explanation:
The maximum attainable volume of the cuboid is 0.33

###### Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
###### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

### Constraints :
1 ≤ perimeter ≤ $`10^9`$
1 ≤ area ≤ $`10^9`$
