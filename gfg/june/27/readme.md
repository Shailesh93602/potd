# Toeplitz matrix
A Toeplitz (or diagonal-constant) matrix is a matrix in which each descending diagonal from left to right is constant, i.e., all elements in a diagonal are the same. Given a rectangular matrix mat, your task is to complete the function isToeplitz which returns 1 if the matrix is Toeplitz otherwise, it returns 0.

### Examples:
#### Input:
mat = [[6, 7, 8],
       [4, 6, 7],
       [1, 4, 6]]
#### Output:
1
#### Explanation:
The test case represents a 3x3 matrix
 6 7 8 
 4 6 7 
 1 4 6
Output:
1(True) as values in all downward diagonals from left to right contain the same elements.

#### Input: 
mat = [[1,2,3],
       [4,5,6]]
#### Output: 
0
#### Explanation:
Matrix of order 2x3 will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 Output: 0(False) as values in all diagonals are not the same.

### Constraints:
1 <= mat.size,mat[0].size <= 40
1 <= mat[i][j] <= 100

###### Expected time complexity: O(n*m)
###### Expected space complexity: O(1)
