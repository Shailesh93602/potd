# N meetings in one room
You are given timings of n meetings in the form of (start[i], end[i]) where start[i] is the start time of meeting i and end[i] is the finish time of meeting i. Return the maximum number of meetings that can be accommodated in a single meeting room, when only one meeting can be held in the meeting room at a particular time. 

Note: The start time of one chosen meeting can't be equal to the end time of the other chosen meeting.

### Examples :
#### Input:
n = 6, start[] = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5], end[] =  [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9]
#### Output:
4
#### Explanation:
Maximum four meetings can be held with given start and end timings. The meetings are - (1, 2), (3, 4), (5,7) and (8,9)

#### Input:
n = 3, start[] = [10, 12, 20], end[] = [20, 25, 30]
#### Output:
1
#### Explanation:
Only one meetings can be held with given start and end timings.

###### Expected Time Complexity: O(n*logn)
###### Expected Auxilliary Space: O(n)

### Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ $`10^5`$
0 ≤ start[i] < end[i] ≤ $`10^6`$
