# Burning Tree
Given a binary tree and a node data called target. Find the minimum time required to burn the complete binary tree if the target is set on fire. It is known that in 1 second all nodes connected to a given node get burned. That is its left child, right child, and parent.
Note: The tree contains unique values.

### Examples : 
#### Input:      
          1
        /   \
      2      3
    /  \      \
   4    5      6
       / \      \
      7   8      9
                   \
                   10
Target Node = 8
#### Output:
7
#### Explanation: 
If leaf with the value 8 is set on fire. 
After 1 sec: 5 is set on fire.
After 2 sec: 2, 7 are set to fire.
After 3 sec: 4, 1 are set to fire.
After 4 sec: 3 is set to fire.
After 5 sec: 6 is set to fire.
After 6 sec: 9 is set to fire.
After 7 sec: 10 is set to fire.
It takes 7s to burn the complete tree.

#### Input:      
          1
        /   \
      2      3
    /  \      \
   4    5      7
  /    / 
 8    10
Target Node = 10
#### Output: 
5

###### Expected Time Complexity: O(number of nodes)
###### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(height of tree)

### Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ $`10^5`$
1 ≤ values of nodes ≤ $`10^5`$
