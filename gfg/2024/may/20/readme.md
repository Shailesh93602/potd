# ModularExponentiation for large numbers
Implement pow(x, n) % M.
In other words, for a given value of x, n, and M, find  (xn) % M.
 

### Example 1:
#### Input:
x = 3, n = 2, m = 4
#### Output:
1
#### Explanation:
32 = 9. 9 % 4 = 1.

### Example 2:
#### Input:
x = 2, n = 6, m = 10
#### Output:
4
#### Explanation:
26 = 64. 64 % 10 = 4.

### Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function PowMod() which takes integers x, n, and M as input parameters and returns xn % M.
 
###### Expected Time Complexity: O(log(n))
###### Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 
### Constraints:
1 ≤ x, n, M ≤ $`10^9`$
