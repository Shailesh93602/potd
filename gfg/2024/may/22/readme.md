# Minimize Max Distance to Gas Station
We have a horizontal number line. On that number line, we have gas stations at positions stations[0], stations[1], ..., stations[N-1], where n = size of the stations array. Now, we add k more gas stations so that d, the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations, is minimized. We have to find the smallest possible value of d. Find the answer exactly to 2 decimal places.

### Example 1:
#### Input:
n = 10
stations = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
k = 9
#### Output:
0.50
#### Explanation:
Each of the 9 stations can be added mid way between all the existing adjacent stations.

### Example 2:
#### Input:
n = 10
stations = [3,6,12,19,33,44,67,72,89,95] 
k = 2 
#### Output:
14.00 
#### Explanation:
Construction of gas stations at 8th(between 72 and 89) and 6th(between 44 and 67) locations.
 
### Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findSmallestMaxDist() which takes a list of stations and integer k as inputs and returns the smallest possible value of d. Find the answer exactly to 2 decimal places.

###### Expected Time Complexity: O(n*log k)
###### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

### Constraint:
10 <= n <= 5000 
0 <= stations[i] <= $`10^9`$
0 <= k <= $`10^5`$
stations is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
