# Identical Linked Lists
iven the two singly Linked Lists respectively. The task is to check whether two linked lists are identical or not. 
Two Linked Lists are identical when they have the same data and with the same arrangement too. If both Linked Lists are identical then return true otherwise return false. 

### Examples:
#### Input:
LinkedList1: 1->2->3->4->5->6
LinkedList2: 99->59->42->20
#### Output:
false

As shown in figure linkedlists are not identical.

#### Input:
LinkedList1: 1->2->3->4->5
LinkedList2: 1->2->3->4->5
#### Output:
true

As shown in figure both are identical.

###### Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
###### xpected Auxilliary Space: O(1)

### Constraints:
1 <= length of lists <= $`10^3`$
