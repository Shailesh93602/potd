# Max distance between same elements
Given an array arr[] with repeated elements, the task is to find the maximum distance between two occurrences of an element.

**Note:** You may assume that every input array has repetitions.

### Examples:
#### Input:
arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]
#### Output:
5
#### Explanation:
distance for 1 is: 5-0 = 5, distance for 2 is : 4-2 = 2, So max distance is 5.

#### Input:
arr = [3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 8, 6, 7, 4, 2]
#### Output:
10
#### Explanation:
maximum distance for 2 is 11-1 = 10, maximum distance for 1 is 4-2 = 2 ,maximum distance for 4 is 10-5 = 5, So max distance is 10.

###### Expected Time Complexity :  O(n)
###### Expected Auxilliary Space : O(n)

### Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= $`10^6`$
1 <= arr[i] <= $`10^9`$
