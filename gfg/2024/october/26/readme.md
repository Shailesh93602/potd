# Occurence of an integer in a Linked List
Given a singly linked list and a key, count the number of occurrences of the given key in the linked list.

### Examples:
#### Input:
Linked List: 1->2->1->2->1->3->1, key = 1

#### Output:
4
#### Explanation: 
1 appears 4 times. 

#### Input:
Linked List: 1->2->1->2->1, key = 3
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfac55df-0612-4041-81b3-991d07fc3fa9)
#### Output:
0
#### Explanation:
3 appears 0 times.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

### Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes, key ≤ $`10^5`$
1 ≤ data of node ≤ $`10^5`$
