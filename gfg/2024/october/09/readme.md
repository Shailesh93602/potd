# Linked List Matrix
Given a Matrix mat of n*n size. Your task is constructing a 2D linked list representation of the given matrix.

#### Input:
mat = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
#### Output:

#### Input:
mat = [[23, 28], [23, 28]]

###### Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
###### Expected Space Complexity: O(n2)

### Constraints:
1 <= mat.size() <= 15
1 <= mat[i][j] <= $`10^4`$
