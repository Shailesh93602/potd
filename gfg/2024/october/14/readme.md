# Count Linked List Nodes
Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

### Examples:
#### Input:
**LinkedList:** 1->2->3->4->5

#### Output:
5
#### Explanation:
Count of nodes in the linked list is 5, which is its length.

#### Input: 
**LinkedList:** 2->4->6->7->5->1->0

#### Output: 
7
#### Explanation:
Count of nodes in the linked list is 7. Hence, the output is 7.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Expected Auxilliary Space:** O(1)

### Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= $`10^5`$
1 <= node->data <= $`10^3`$
