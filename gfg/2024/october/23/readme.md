# Find the Sum of Last N nodes of the Linked List
Given a single linked list, calculate the sum of the last n nodes.

**Note:** It is guaranteed that n <= number of nodes.

### Examples:

Linked List: 5->9->6->3->4->10, n = 3
#### Output: 
17
#### Explanation:
The sum of the last three nodes in the linked list is 3 + 4 + 10 = 17.

#### Input:
Linked List: 1->2, n = 2

#### Output: 
3
#### Explanation:
The sum of the last two nodes in the linked list is 2 + 1 = 3.

### Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes, n <= $`10^5`$
1 <= node->data <= $`10^3`$
