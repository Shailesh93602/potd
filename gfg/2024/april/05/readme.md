# Strictly Increasing Array
Given an array nums of n positive integers. Find the minimum number of operations required to modify the array such that array elements are in strictly increasing order (nums[i] < nums[i+1]).
Changing a number to greater or lesser than original number is counted as one operation.

Note: Array elements can become negative after applying operation.

### Example 1:
#### Input:
n = 6
nums = [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4]
#### Output: 
2
#### Explanation: 
By decreasing 6 by 2 and increasing 4 by 2, nums will be like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] which is stricly increasing.

### Example 2:
#### Input: 
n = 4
nums = [1, 1, 1, 1]
#### Output: 
3
#### Explanation: 
One such array after operation can be [-2, -1, 0, 1]. We require atleast 3 operations for this example.

### Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function min_opeartions() which takes the array nums as input parameter and returns the minimum number of opeartion needed to make the array strictly increasing.

###### Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
###### Expected Space Complexity: O(n)

### Constraints: 
1 <= n <= $`10^3`$
1 <= nums[i] <= $`10^9`$
