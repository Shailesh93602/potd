# Maximum Connected group
You are given a square binary grid. A grid is considered binary if every value in the grid is either 1 or 0. You can change at most one cell in the grid from 0 to 1. You need to find the largest group of connected  1's. Two cells are said to be connected if both are adjacent to each other and both have the same value.

### Examples :
#### Input:
grid = [1, 1]
       [0, 1]
#### Output:
4
#### Explanation: 
By changing cell (2,1), we can obtain a connected group of 4 1's
[1, 1]
[1, 1]

#### Input:
grid = [1, 0, 1]
       [1, 0, 1]
       [1, 0, 1]
#### Output:
7
#### Explanation:
By changing cell (3,2), we can obtain a connected group of 7 1's
[1, 0, 1]
[1, 0, 1]
[1, 1, 1]

###### Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
###### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n2)

### Constraints:
1 <= size of the grid<= 500
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1
