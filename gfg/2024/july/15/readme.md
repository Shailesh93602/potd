# Smallest number
Given two integers s and d. The task is to find the smallest number such that the sum of its digits is s and the number of digits in the number are d. Return a string that is the smallest possible number. If it is not possible then return -1.

### Examples:
#### Input: 
s = 9, d = 2
#### Output:
18 
#### Explanation:
18 is the smallest number possible with the sum of digits = 9 and total digits = 2.

#### Input:
s = 20, d = 3 
#### Output:
299 
#### Explanation: 
299 is the smallest number possible with the sum of digits = 20 and total digits = 3.

###### Expected Time Complexity: O(d)
###### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

### Constraints:
1 ≤ s ≤ 100
1 ≤ d ≤ 6
