# Largest BST
Given a binary tree. Find the size of its largest subtree which is a Binary Search Tree.
Note: Here Size equals the number of nodes in the subtree.

### Examples:
#### Input: 
          1
        /  \
        4   4              
       / \ 
      6   8
#### Output:
1 
#### Explanation:
There's no sub-tree with size greater than 1 which forms a BST. All the leaf Nodes are the BSTs with size equal to 1.

#### Input: 
          6
        /   \
      6      2              
       \    / \
        2  1   3
#### Output: 
3
#### Explanation:
The following sub-tree is a BST of size 3:  
    2
  /   \
 1     3
                                                      
###### Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
###### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the BST).

### Constraints:
1 ≤ Number of nodes ≤ $`10^5`$
1 ≤ Data of a node ≤ $`10^6`$
