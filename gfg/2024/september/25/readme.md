# Palindrome Linked List
Given a singly linked list of integers. The task is to check if the given linked list is palindrome or not.

### Examples:
#### Input: 
LinkedList: 1->2->1->1->2->1
#### Output: 
true
#### Explanation: 
The given linked list is 1->2->1->1->2->1 , which is a palindrome and Hence, the output is true.

#### Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4
#### Output:
false
#### Explanation:
The given linked list is 1->2->3->4, which is not a palindrome and Hence, the output is false.

###### Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
###### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1) 
**Note:** You should not use the recursive stack space as well

### Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= $`10^5`$
1 ≤ node->data ≤ $`10^3`$
