# Level order traversal
Given a root of a binary tree with n nodes, find its level order traversal.
Level order traversal of a tree is breadth-first traversal for the tree.


## Your Task:
You don't have to take any input. Complete the function levelOrder() that takes the root node as input parameter and returns a list of integers containing the level order traversal of the given Binary Tree.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

### Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ Data of a node ≤ 10^9
