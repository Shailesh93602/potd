# Majority Element
Given an array arr[]. Find the majority element in the array. If no majority element exists, return -1.

**Note:** A majority element in an array is an element that appears strictly more than arr.size()/2 times in the array.

### Examples:
#### Input:
arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 1]
#### Output:
1
#### Explanation:
Since, 1 is present more than 7/2 times, so it is the majority element.

#### Input:
arr[] = [7]
#### Output:
7
#### Explanation:
Since, 7 is single element and present more than 1/2 times, so it is the majority element.

#### Input: 
arr[] = [2, 13]
#### Output:
-1
#### Explanation:
Since, no element is present more than 2/2 times, so there is no majority element.

### Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ $`10^5`$
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ $`10^5`$
