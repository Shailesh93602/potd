# Missing in Array
You are given an array arr[] of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. Your task is to identify and return the missing element.

### Examples:
#### Input:
arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5]
#### Output:
4
#### Explanation:
All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.

#### Input: 
arr[] = [8, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 1]
#### Output:
6
#### Explanation:
All the numbers from 1 to 8 are present except 6.

#### Input:
arr[] = [1]
#### Output:
2
#### Explanation:
Only 1 is present so the missing element is 2.

### Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ $`10^6`$
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ arr.size() + 1
