# Unique Number I
Given a unsorted array arr[] of positive integers having all the numbers occurring exactly twice, except for one number which will occur only once. Find the number occurring only once.

### Examples:
#### Input:
arr[] = [1, 2, 1, 5, 5]
#### Output: 
2
#### Explanation: 
Since 2 occurs once, while other numbers occur twice, 2 is the answer.

#### Input: 
arr[] = [2, 30, 2, 15, 20, 30, 15]
#### Output:
20
#### Explanation:
Since 20 occurs once, while other numbers occur twice, 20 is the answer.

### Constraints
1 ≤  arr.size()  ≤ $`10^6`$
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ $`10^9`$
