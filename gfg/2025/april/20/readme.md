# Find Only Repetitive Element from 1 to n-1
Given an array arr[] of size n, filled with numbers from 1 to n-1 in random order. The array has only one repetitive element. Your task is to find the repetitive element.

**Note:** It is guaranteed that there is a repeating element present in the array.

### Examples:
#### Input:
arr[] = [1, 3, 2, 3, 4]
#### Output:
3 
#### Explanation:
The number 3 is the only repeating element.

#### Input:
arr[] = [1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
#### Output:
1  
#### Explanation:
The number 1 is the only repeating element.

#### Input:
arr[] = [1, 1]  
#### Output:
1
#### Explanation:
The array is of size 2 with both elements being 1, making 1 the repeating element.

### Constraints:
2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ $`10^5`$
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n-1
