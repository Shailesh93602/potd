# Multiply two strings
Given two numbers as strings s1 and s2. Calculate their Product.
**Note:** The numbers can be negative and You are not allowed to use any built-in function or convert the strings to integers. There can be zeros in the begining of the numbers. You don't need to specify '+' sign in the begining of positive numbers.

### Examples:
#### Input:
s1 = "0033", s2 = "2"
#### Output:
"66"
#### Explanation:
33 * 2 = 66

#### Input:
s1 = "11", s2 = "23"
#### Output:
"253"
#### Explanation:
11 * 23  = 253

#### Input:
s1 = "123", s2 = "0"
#### Output:
"0"
#### Explanation:
Anything multiplied by 0 is equal to 0.

### Constraints:
1 ≤ s1.size() ≤ $`10^3`$
1 ≤ s2.size() ≤ $`10^3`$
