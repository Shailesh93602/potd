# Sort the given array after applying the given equation
Given an integer array arr[] sorted in ascending order, along with three integers: A, B, and C. The task is to transform each element x in the array using the quadratic function A*(x2) + B*x + C. After applying this transformation to every element, return the modified array in sorted order.

### Examples:
#### Input:
arr[] = [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4], A = 1, B = 3, C = 5
#### Output:
[3, 5, 9, 15, 33]
#### Explanation:
After applying f(x) = 1*(x2)+ 3*x + 5 to each x, we get [9, 3, 5, 15, 33]. After sorting this array, the array becomes [3, 5, 9, 15, 33].

#### Input:
arr[] = [-3, -1, 2, 4], A = -1, B = 0, C = 0
#### Output: 
[-16, -9, -4, -1]
#### Explanation:
After applying f(x) = -1*(x2) + 0*x + 0 to each x, we get [ -9, -1, -4, -16 ]. After sorting this array, the array becomes  [-16, -9, -4, -1].

### Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ $`10^6`$
-$`10^3`$ ≤ arr[i], A, B, C ≤ $`10^3`$
