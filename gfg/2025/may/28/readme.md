# Find rectangle with corners as 1
Given an n x m binary matrix mat[][] containing only 0s and 1s, determine if there exists a rectangle within the matrix such that all four corners of the rectangle are 1. If such a rectangle exists, return true; otherwise, return false.

### Example:
#### Input: 
mat[][] =
[[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0], 
[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]] 
#### Output:
true
#### Explanation:
Valid corners are at index (1,2), (1,4), (3,2), (3,4) 

#### Input:
mat[][] =
[[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0]]
#### Output: 
false
#### Explanation: 
There are no valid corners.

### Constraints:
1 <= n, m <= 200
0 <= mat[i] <= 1
