# Sum of all substrings of a number
Given an integer s represented as a string, the task is to get the sum of all possible sub-strings of this string.

**Note:** The number may have leading zeros.
It is guaranteed that the total sum will fit within a 32-bit signed integer.

### Examples:
#### Input:
s = "6759"
#### Output: 
8421
#### Explanation:
Sum = 6 + 7 + 5 + 9 + 67 + 75 + 59 + 675 + 759 + 6759 = 8421

#### Input: 
s = "421"
#### Output: 
491
#### Explanation: 
Sum = 4 + 2 + 1 + 42 + 21 + 421 = 491

### Constraints:
1 <= |s| <= 9
