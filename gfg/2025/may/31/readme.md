# Kth element in Matrix
Given a matrix mat[][] of size n*n, where each row and column is sorted in non-decreasing order. Find the kth smallest element in the matrix.

### Examples:
#### Input:
n = 4, mat[][] = [[16, 28, 60, 64], [22, 41, 63, 91], [27, 50, 87, 93], [36, 78, 87, 94]], k = 3
#### Output:
27
#### Explanation:
27 is the 3rd smallest element.

#### Input:
n = 4, mat[][] = [[10, 20, 30, 40], [15, 25, 35, 45], [24, 29, 37, 48], [32, 33, 39, 50]], k = 7
#### Output:
30
#### Explanation:
30 is the 7th smallest element.

### Constraints:
1 <= n <= 500
1 <= mat[i][j] <= 10000
1 <= k <= n*n
