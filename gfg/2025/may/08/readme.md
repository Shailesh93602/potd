# Missing element of AP
Given a sorted array arr[] that represents an Arithmetic Progression (AP) with exactly one missing element, find the missing number.

**Note:** An element will always exist that, upon inserting into a sequence forms Arithmetic progression. If the given sequence already forms a valid complete AP, return the (n+1)-th element that would come next in the sequence.

### Examples:
#### Input: 
arr[] = [2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14]
#### Output:
6
#### Explanation: 
Actual AP should be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.

#### Input: 
arr[] = [1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 31]
#### Output: 
26
#### Explanation: 
Actual AP should be 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31.

#### Input:
arr[] = [4, 7, 10, 13, 16]
#### Output: 
19
#### Explanation:
Since the sequence already forms a valid AP, the next element after 16 in the sequence would be 19. Therefore, the output is 19.

### Constraints:
2 <= arr.size() <= $`10^5`$
0 <= arr[i] <= $`2*10^7`$
