# Dice throw
Given n dice each with m faces. Find the number of ways to get sum x which is the summation of values on each face when all the dice are thrown.

### Example:
#### Input:
m = 6, n = 3, x = 12
#### Output: 
25
#### Explanation:
There are 25 total ways to get the Sum 12 using 3 dices with faces from 1 to 6.

#### Input: 
m = 2, n = 3, x = 6
#### Output:
1
#### Explanation: 
There is only 1 way to get the Sum 6 using 3 dices with faces from 1 to 2. All the dices will have to land on 2.

### Constraints:
1 <= m,n,x <= 50
