# Sum-string
Given a string s consisting of digits, determine whether it can be classified as a sum-string.

**A sum-string is a string that can be split into two or more non-empty substrings such that:**
The rightmost substring is equal to the sum of the two substrings immediately before it (interpreted as integers).

This condition must apply recursively to the substrings before it.

The rightmost substring (and any number in the sum) must not contain leading zeroes, unless the number is exactly '0'.

### Examples:
#### Input:
s = "12243660"
#### Output:
true
#### Explanation:
**The string can be split as {"12", "24", "36", "60"} where each number is the sum of the two before it:**
24 = 12 + 12, 36 = 12 + 24, and 60 = 24 + 36. Hence, it is a sum-string.

#### Input: 
s = "1111112223"
#### Output:
true
#### Explanation: 
**Split the string as {"1", "111", "112", "223"}, where:**
112 = 1 + 111 and 223 = 111 + 112. Hence, it follows the sum-string rule.

#### Input:
s = "123456"
#### Output: 
false
#### Explanation:
There is no valid split of the string such that each part satisfies the sum-string property recursively.

### Constraints:
1 <= s.size() <= 100
String consists of characters from '0' to '9'.
