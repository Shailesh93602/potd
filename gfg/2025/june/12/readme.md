# K closest elements
You are given a sorted array arr[] of unique integers, an integer k, and a target value x. Return exactly k elements from the array closest to x, excluding x if it exists.

**An element a is closer to x than b if:**
a - x| < |b - x|, or
|a - x| == |b - x| and a > b (i.e., prefer the larger element if tied)


Return the k closest elements in order of closeness.

### Examples:
#### Input:
arr[] = [1, 3, 4, 10, 12], k = 2, x = 4
#### Output:
3 1
#### Explanation:
4 is excluded, Closest elements to 4 are: 3 (1), 1 (3). So, the 2 closest elements are: 3 1

#### Input:
arr[] = [12, 16, 22, 30, 35, 39, 42, 45, 48, 50, 53, 55, 56], k = 4, x = 35
#### Output: 
39 30 42 45
#### Explanation: 
First closest element to 35 is 39.
Second closest element to 35 is 30.
Third closest element to 35 is 42.
And fourth closest element to 35 is 45.

### Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ $`10^5`$
1 ≤ k ≤ arr.size()
1 ≤ x ≤ $`10^6`$
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ $`10^6`$
