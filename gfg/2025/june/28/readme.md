# Counting elements in two arrays
You are given two unsorted arrays a[] and b[]. Both arrays may contain duplicate elements. For each element in a[], your task is to count how many elements in b[] are less than or equal to that element.

### Examples:
#### Input: 
a[] = [4, 8, 7, 5, 1], b[] = [4, 48, 3, 0, 1, 1, 5]
#### Output: 
[5, 6, 6, 6, 3]
#### Explanation: 
For a[0] = 4, there are 5 elements in b (4, 3, 0, 1, 1) that are ≤ 4.
For a[1] = 8 and a[2] = 7, there are 6 elements in b that are ≤ 8 and ≤ 7.
For a[3] = 5, there are 6 elements in b that are ≤ 5.
For a[4] = 1, there are 3 elements in b (0, 1, 1) that are ≤ 1.

#### Input:
a[] = [10, 20], b[] = [30, 40, 50]
#### Output:
[0, 0]
#### Explanation: 
For a[0] = 10 and a[1] = 20, there are no elements in b that are less than or equal to 10 or 20. Hence, the output is [0, 0].

### Constraints:
1 ≤ a.size(), b.size() ≤ $`10^5`$
0 ≤ a[i], b[j] ≤ $`10^5`$
