# Minimum sum
Given an array arr[ ] consisting of digits, your task is to form two numbers using all the digits such that their sum is minimized. Return the minimum possible sum as a string with no leading zeroes.

### Examples:
#### Input:
arr[] = [6, 8, 4, 5, 2, 3]
#### Output:
"604"
#### Explanation: 
The minimum sum is formed by numbers 358 and 246.
 
#### Input: 
arr[] = [5, 3, 0, 7, 4]
#### Output: 
"82"
#### Explanation: 
The minimum sum is formed by numbers 35 and 047.

#### Input:
arr[] = [9, 4]
#### Output: 
"13"
#### Explanation: 
The minimum sum is formed by numbers 9 and 4.

### Constraints:
2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ $`10^6`$
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 9
