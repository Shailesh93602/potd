# LCS of three strings
Given three strings s1, s2, and s3 containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits, find the length of longest common sub-sequence in all three given strings.

### Examples:
#### Input:
s1 = "geeks", s2 = "geeksfor", s3 = "geeksforgeeks"
#### Output: 
5
#### Explanation: 
"geeks"is the longest common subsequence with length 5.

#### Input:
s1 = "abcd1e2", s2 = "bc12ea", s3 = "bd1ea"
#### Output:
3
#### Explanation: 
Longest common subsequence is "b1e" i.e. length = 3.

### Constraints:
1  ≤  s1.size(), s2.size(), s3.size()  ≤  100
