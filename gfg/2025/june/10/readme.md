# Exactly one swap
Given a string s, return the number of distinct strings that can be obtained by exactly one swap of two different indices (i < j).

### Examples:

6
#### Explanation:

#### Input:
s = "aaaa"
#### Output:
1
#### Explanation: 
Only one distinct string is possible after one swap(i.e "aaaa")

### Constraints:
2 ≤ s.size() ≤ $`10^4`$
