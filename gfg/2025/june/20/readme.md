# Group Balls by Sequence
**You are given an array arr[] of positive integers, where each element arr[i] represents the number written on the i-th ball, and a positive integer k.
Your task is to determine whether it is possible to rearrange all the balls into groups such that:**
Each group contains exactly k balls.
The numbers in each group are consecutive integers

### Examples:
#### Input:
arr[] = [10, 1, 2, 11], k = 2
#### Output: 
true
#### Explanation:
The hand can be rearranged as [1, 2], [10, 11]. There are two groups of size 2. Each group has 2 consecutive cards.

#### Input: 
arr[] = [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], k = 2
#### Output:
false
#### Explanation:
The hand cannot be rearranged into groups of 2, since there are 5 cards, and 5 cards cannot be divided into groups of 2.

### Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ $`10^6`$
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ $`10^5`$
1 ≤ k ≤ $`10^3`$
