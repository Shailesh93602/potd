# Maximum path sum from any node
Given a binary tree, the task is to find the maximum path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree.

### Examples:
#### Input: 
root[] = [10, 2, 10, 20, 1, N, -25, N, N, N, N, 3, 4]
#### Output: 
42

Max path sum is represented using green colour nodes in the above binary tree.

#### Input: 
root[] = [-17, 11, 4, 20, -2, 10]
#### Output:
31

Max path sum is represented using green colour nodes in the above binary tree.

### Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ $`10^3`$
-$`10^4`$ ≤ node->data ≤ $`10^4`$
