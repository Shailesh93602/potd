# Activity Selection
You are given a set of activities, each with a start time and a finish time, represented by the arrays start[] and finish[], respectively. A single person can perform only one activity at a time, meaning no two activities can overlap. Your task is to determine the maximum number of activities that a person can complete in a day.

### Examples:
#### Input:
start[] = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5], finish[] = [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9]
#### Output: 
4
#### Explanation:
A person can perform at most four activities. The maximum set of activities that can be executed is {0, 1, 3, 4}

#### Input: 
start[] = [10, 12, 20], finish[] = [20, 25, 30]
#### Output: 
1
#### Explanation:
A person can perform at most one activity.

#### Input:
start[] = [1, 3, 2, 5], finish[] = [2, 4, 3, 6]
#### Output:
3
#### Explanation:
A person can perform activities 0, 1 and 3.

### Constraints:
1 ≤ start.size() = finish.size() ≤ $`2*10^5`$
1 ≤ start[i] ≤ finish[i] ≤ $`10^9`$
