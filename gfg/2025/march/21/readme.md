# Stickler Thief
Stickler the thief wants to loot money from the houses arranged in a line. He cannot loot two consecutive houses and aims to maximize his total loot.
Given an array, arr[] where arr[i] represents the amount of money in the i-th house.
Determine the maximum amount he can loot.

### Examples:
#### Input:
arr[] = [6, 5, 5, 7, 4]
#### Output: 
15
#### Explanation:
Maximum amount he can get by looting 1st, 3rd and 5th house. Which is 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.

#### Input: 
arr[] = [1, 5, 3]
#### Output:
5
#### Explanation: 
Loot only 2nd house and get maximum amount of 5.

#### Input:
arr[] = [4, 4, 4, 4]
#### Output: 
8
#### Explanation:
The optimal choice is to loot every alternate house. Looting the 1st and 3rd houses, or the 2nd and 4th, both give a maximum total of 4 + 4 = 8.

### Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ $`10^5`$
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ $`10^4`$
