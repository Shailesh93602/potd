# Stock Buy and Sell – Max 2 Transactions Allowed
In daily share trading, a trader buys shares and sells them on the same day. If the trader is allowed to make at most 2 transactions in a day, find out the maximum profit that a share trader could have made.

You are given an array prices[] representing stock prices throughout the day. Note that the second transaction can only start after the first one is complete (buy->sell->buy->sell).

### Examples:
#### Input: 
prices[] = [10, 22, 5, 75, 65, 80]
#### Output:
87
#### Explanation: 
Trader will buy at 10 and sells at 22. 
Profit earned in 1st transaction = 22 - 10 = 12. 
Then he buys at 5 and sell at 80. 
Profit earned in 2nd transaction = 80 - 5 = 75. 
Total profit earned = 12 + 75 = 87. 

#### Input:
prices[] = [2, 30, 15, 10, 8, 25, 80]
#### Output:
100
#### Explanation: 
Trader will buy at 2 and sells at 30. 
Profit earned in 1st transaction = 30 - 2 = 28. 
Then he buys at 8 and sell at 80. 
Profit earned in 2nd transaction = 80 - 8 = 72. 
Total profit earned = 28 + 72 = 100.

### Constraints:
1 <= prices.size() <= $`10^5`$
1 <= prices[i] <= $`10^5`$
