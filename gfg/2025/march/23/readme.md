# Total Decoding Messages
**A message containing letters A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:**
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26

You are given a string digits. You have to determine the total number of ways that message can be decoded.

### Examples:
#### Input:
digits = "123"
#### Output:
3
#### Explanation:
"123" can be decoded as "ABC"(1, 2, 3), "LC"(12, 3) and "AW"(1, 23).

#### Input:
digits = "90"
#### Output:
0
#### Explanation:
"90" cannot be decoded, as it's an invalid string and we cannot decode '0'.

#### Input:
digits = "05"
#### Output:
0
#### Explanation:
"05" cannot be mapped to "E" because of the leading zero ("5" is different from "05"), the string is not a valid encoding message.

### Constraints:
1 ≤ digits.size() ≤ $`10^3`$
