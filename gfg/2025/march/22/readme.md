# Stickler Thief II
You are given an array arr[] which represents houses arranged in a circle, where each house has a certain value. A thief aims to maximize the total stolen value without robbing two adjacent houses.
Determine the maximum amount the thief can steal.

**Note:** Since the houses are in a circle, the first and last houses are also considered adjacent.

### Examples:
#### Input:
arr[] = [2, 3, 2]
#### Output:
3
#### Explanation: 
arr[0] and arr[2] can't be robbed because they are adjacent houses. Thus, 3 is the maximum value thief can rob.

#### Input:
arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 1]
#### Output:
4
#### Explanation:
Maximum stolen value: arr[0] + arr[2] = 1 + 3 = 4

#### Input:
arr[] = [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]
#### Output:
5
#### Explanation:
Maximum stolen value: arr[0] + arr[2] = 2 + 3 = 5 or arr[2] + arr[4] = 3 + 2 = 5

### Constraints:
2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ $`10^5`$
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ $`10^4`$
