# Divisible by 13
Given a number represented as a string s (which may be very large), check whether it is divisible by 13 or not.

### Examples:
#### Input:
s = "2911285"
#### Output:
true
#### Explanation:
2911285 / 13 = 223945, which is a whole number with no remainder.

#### Input:
s = "27"
#### Output:
false
#### Explanation:
27 / 13 ≈ 2.0769..., which is not a whole number (there is a remainder).

### Constraints:
1 ≤  s.size()  ≤ $`10^5`$
