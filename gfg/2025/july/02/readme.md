# Longest subarray with Atmost two distinct integers
Given an array arr[] consisting of positive integers, your task is to find the length of the longest subarray that contains at most two distinct integers.

### Examples:
#### Input: 
arr[] = [2, 1, 2]
#### Output: 
3
#### Explanation: 
The entire array [2, 1, 2] contains at most two distinct integers (2 and 1). Hence, the length of the longest subarray is 3.

#### Input: 
arr[] = [3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]
#### Output: 
5
#### Explanation:
The longest subarray containing at most two distinct integers is [1, 2, 2, 2, 2], which has a length of 5.

### Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ $`10^5`$
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ $`10^5`$
