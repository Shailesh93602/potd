# Trail of ones
Given an integer n, the task is to count the number of binary strings of length n that contains at least one pair of consecutive 1's.
**Note:** A binary string is a sequence made up of only 0's and 1's.

### Examples:
#### Input: 
n = 2
#### Output: 
1
#### Explanation: 
There are 4 strings of length 2, the strings are 00, 01, 10, and 11. Only the string 11 has consecutive 1's.

#### Input:
n = 3
#### Output:
3
#### Explanation:
There are 8 strings of length 3, the strings are 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110 and 111. The strings with consecutive 1's are 011, 110 and 111.

#### Input:
n = 5
#### Output: 
19
#### Explanation:
There are 19 strings having at least one pair of consecutive 1's.

### Constraints:
2 ≤ n ≤ 30
