# Maximum sum of elements not part of LIS
Given an array arr[] of positive integers, your task is to find the maximum possible sum of all elements that are not part of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS).

### Examples:
#### Input: 
arr[] = [4, 6, 1, 2, 3, 8]
#### Output:
10
#### Explanation: 
The elements which are not in LIS is 4 and 6.

#### Input: 
arr[] = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
#### Output: 
14
#### Explanation: 
The elements which are not in LIS is 5, 4, 3 and 2.

### Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ $`10^3`$
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ $`10^5`$
